We are starting this recording right now. What's your favorite city? My favorite city is Toronto. What's your favorite CMH floor? My favorite CMH floor is floor 11.5.

What do you like to get at the CMH Caf? Um, I personally mainly get the burrito bowls. Not because they're good, but because, like, I think they will cost the most money and they're better than all the other options.

What's your favorite building to study in? My favorite building to study in is probably the Quantum Nano Center. What's your favorite piece of grass? My favorite piece of grass is the one outside. Um, like, was it like Weeby hall or some like that?

Okay, we're gonna stop it now.
